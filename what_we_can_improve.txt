What we can improve (we have no time for implementing test task, sorry)

- plug-in RequireJS
- organize every constructor like a module 
- destroy using of global vars (like App.session) and inject neccessary vars in modules
- extract each template in a separate file
- reorganize base infrastructure logic (App, Router), but we need to know real requirements
- fix markup html and css
