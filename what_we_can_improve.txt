Possible further improvements:

- use RequireJS for modules management
- organize every constructor like a module 
- instead of using global vars (like App.session) inject neccessary vars into modules
- move each template to a separate file
- reorganize base infrastructure logic (App, Router), but we need to know real requirements
- fix markup html and css
