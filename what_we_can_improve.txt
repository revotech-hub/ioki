Possible further improvements:

- use RequireJS for modules management
- instead of using global vars (like App.session) inject neccessary vars into modules
- move each template to a separate file

Known issues:
- small html and css layout issues
- dragging image with answer options to answer textboxes provides wrong result, as the image should be splitted into several images
